Built using the following steps:

  - The main and development libgnutls, libgmp, libhogweed, libintl,
    libnettle, libp11-kit, libffi, libtasn1, libgcrypt, libgpg-error
    and libgcc packages were downloaded from
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win32/openSUSE_13.1/noarch/
  - Definition files were created thanks to Dependency Walker.
  - Import libraries were created using the MSVC++ "lib" utility.
  - The ssize_t typedef was commented out in gcrypt.h; we define it
    elsewhere.
  - Libgcrypt 1.6.2 was recompiled without the support for AES-NI so as to fix a crash reported in bug 10476
