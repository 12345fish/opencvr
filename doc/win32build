Intel Media SDK

The media acceleration DLLs are distributed with the graphics driver, not the Intel Media SDK.
In many cases the default graphics driver may not provide all of the files and registry entries
needed. For best results, please update to the latest driver available from
http://downloadcenter.intel.com/ before attempting a new install. While some systems may
require a vendor-approved driver, the Intel drivers are usually appropriate. These drivers can
be found by selecting “Graphics” as the product family at the Download Center site. 

The graphics driver installer populates the Intel Media SDK directories under “c:\program
files\Intel\Media SDK”, or “c:\program files (x86)\Intel\Media SDK” on 64 bit OS installs. The
Intel Media SDK hardware acceleration DLLs and certified HW Media Foundation Transforms
can be found here.
